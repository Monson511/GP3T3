              How to Safely Contain an Animal

            <ul>
              <li>Find a container with a lid that you can secure.</li>
              <li>Punch air holes in the lid.</li>
              <li>If it's a small, non-rabies vector animal, drop a hand/kitchen towel over the animal, gently pick it up and place it in the box with the towel. Secure the lid.</li>
              <li>If it's a larger animal, set the box or transport tub on its side next to the animal. Using your snow shovel gently nudge or slide the animal into the box. Slowly tilt the box upright so the animal gently slides to the bottom of it. Place a towel in the box with the animal to help reduce stress during transport. Secure the lid.</li>
              <li>If it's an animal that can cause you physical harm (herons, loons, swans, fox, etc.), we're happy to help you determine the best approach over the phone (651-486-9453). You can also call your city's non-emergency police number and ask for assistance in containing the animal. They may not bring it to us, you should offer to do the transport when you call them.</li>

              <ol>
                <li> if any of these are a yes, simply bring the animal in during our operating hours. No need to call first:
                  <ul>
                    <li>bleeding/obviously injured/you can see bruising</li>
                    <li>emaciated/ribs showing</li>
                    <li>has flies, worms or ants on it</li>
                    <li>has been handled by a cat</li>
                    <li>was alone outside overnight or all day long</li>
                    <li>was sitting next to a deceased parent</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>if it's a bunny that is larger than a tennis ball, and its ears are upright, it's old enough to be on its own! They're not incredibly savvy to all the danges in life yet, so you may want to check to see if it's sitting in the yard before letting your dogs out, mowing your lawn, etc. If it is, just shoo it under a shrub or bush.</li>
                <li>if you find a group of squirrels at the base of a tree, leave them. Mom is actively moving them to a new nest. She can only move them one at a time. It may take her all day, just let her go about her business. If she leaves any behind after dusk, she is not coming back for them. Bring them inside, keep them warm overnight (do not feed them) and bring them in to us in the morning (we open at 9am).</li>
                <li>if a dog has dug up a bunny nest and the bunnies are uninjured, put them back in the nest and cover them with the nest material. Take a laundry basket and a couple tent stakes, and anytime you let your dog out into the yard, simply put the laundry basket over the nest like a protective dome. Stake it to the ground so the dog cannot push it off the nest. Incredibly simple! Will allow you and your dog to enjoy your yard all day long. Just remember to uncover the nest when you bring your dog inside.</li>
                <li>if it's a fawn and uninjured, leave the fawn where it is and call us.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Any other questions about what to do with infant or young animals, just give us a call (651-486-9453). Your call will go to voicemail. Please leave a number we can reach you at, with a working voicemail, and a description of the situation. We have a team dedicated to just returning voicemails - that's how busy we are. You'll hear from us within an hour.</p>
              <p>Thank you for helping us keep healthy animals in the wild with their families!</p>

                <li>If, when checking the nest on the 2nd or 3rd day, you notice they are declining, please bring in to the Center.</li>
                <li>If your dog or cat has disturbed the nest, please only bring in any bunnies who have been injured or have been in your cat's mouth.</li>

                <li>If you cannot choose the original site, the location must be within 5' or the parents may not care for the birds.</li>
                <li>When the parents continually push a baby bird from the nest, most likely there is something wrong with that bird. You may bring the bird to the Center at this time.</li>
                <li>A fledgling bird will leave the nest before it can fly. We know it's stressful to watch the baby robins running around in your yard, but that's the way Nature works.</li>
